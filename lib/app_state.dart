This means that you may notice a decrease in the amount of blood. Instead of the heavier flow experienced during the initial days, the blood may become more like spotting or light bleeding.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Darker Blood:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">The color of menstrual blood may change to a darker color, ranging from dark red to brown. This change in color is normal and occurs as the blood takes longer to exit the body.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Changes in Texture:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">As the period nears its end, the consistency of the blood may also change. It can become thicker or clotted due to the longer exposure to air while still inside the body. It&apos;s important to note that small clots are usually normal, but if you experience larger clots or prolonged clotting, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Reduced Symptoms:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">As the menstrual cycle comes to a close, any symptoms experienced during the period, such as abdominal cramps, bloating, or breast tenderness, may gradually subside. The body&apos;s hormone levels start to stabilize, and the discomfort associated with menstruation usually diminishes.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Emotional Changes:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Hormonal fluctuations can affect emotions during the entire menstrual cycle. Towards the end of the period, some girls may experience relief or a shift in mood as the hormone levels regulate. However, it&apos;s important to remember that everyone&apos;s experience is unique, and emotional changes can vary from person to person.</p>\n    <p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that everyone&rsquo;s menstrual cycle is different, and these changes can vary in their intensity and duration. It&apos;s completely normal to experience some irregularities since your body adjusts to the hormonal changes. Over time, your menstrual cycle will likely become more regular and predictable.</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>',

This is attributed to the rising levels of estrogen, which can have a positive effect on overall well-being.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Clearer Skin:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can affect your skin.

This can be attributed to hormonal changes that affect the body&apos;s sensory perception.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Positive Mood:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Ovulation is associated with an increase in estrogen levels, which can contribute to a more positive mood and a sense of well-being.

This increase is a result of the hormone progesterone, which is released after ovulation. Tracking your basal body temperature can help you understand your menstrual cycle better.</p>\n    <h2 style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Breast Tenderness:</span></h2>\n    <p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Many girls experience breast tenderness or sensitivity during the luteal phase.

The reason you might experience cramps during this phase is because of something called prostaglandins. These are chemicals that your body releases to help your uterus get ready in case there\'s a fertilized egg. But sometimes, these prostaglandins can cause the muscles in your uterus to squeeze too hard, which leads to cramps.</p>\n    <p>It\'s important to know that not every girl experiences cramps during the luteal phase, and if you do, the intensity can vary. Some girls have mild cramps that feel like a dull ache, while others might have stronger cramps that feel more uncomfortable.</p>\n    <p>But don\'t worry, there are things you can do to help relieve the cramps! Applying a warm heating pad or taking a warm bath can help relax the muscles and make you feel better. You can also try gentle exercises like stretching or going for a walk, as these can help reduce the cramps too.</p>\n    <p>If the cramps become too intense or start to interfere with your daily activities, it\'s a good idea to talk to a trusted adult, like your mom or a healthcare professional. They can give you more guidance and make sure everything is okay.</p>\n    <p>Remember, having cramps during the luteal phase is a normal part of your menstrual cycle. It might not feel great, but it\'s a sign that your body is working the way it should. Just take care of yourself, try some of the tips I mentioned, and reach out for help if you need it. You\'re doing great!</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n',

PMS refers to a combination of physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that occur in the days or weeks leading up to menstruation. Cramping or abdominal discomfort is among the physical symptoms associated with PMS.</p>\n    <p>During PMS, hormonal changes can cause the uterus to contract, leading to cramps. These cramps are often similar to menstrual cramps but occur before the actual period begins. The severity of PMS cramps can vary from person to person, ranging from mild to more intense.</p>\n    <p>While experiencing cramps during PMS is common, it\'s essential to pay attention to the severity of the pain and how it impacts your daily life. If the cramps are severe and significantly interfere with your ability to function, it\'s a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions or discuss potential management strategies.</p>\n    <p>Remember, if you have concerns about your PMS symptoms or if they become increasingly severe, it\'s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized advice and guidance.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n',
